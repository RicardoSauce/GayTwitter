## 2021: WIP
This project has not been further developed due to graduate studies. However, with some interest, I would be eager to revisit this project with a team to see what discoveries can be made. 

## Progress so far in 2019 

#### Spring Semester, 2019 @ SLU

Task | Work completed | Notes
------| ---------------| ---------
Pull more tweets | Updated tweets/added more to corpus | Will want to add more, probably create a listener function to pull tweets.
Process and clean data | Done within twitter_senti.py | Will probably create bash script to clean up .csv files.
Implement Sentiment Analysis | Performs analysis on data set, accuracy may be off. | Most likely due to data processing as explained above.
Evaluation | Presents accuracy using Keras metrics | Add visualization for accuracy, validation, and error count


# Progress made in summer, 2018
This was the preliminary work from my summer research position with the McNair Scholars program. I hope to continue developing this ML project for the means of improving NLP models in place today.
