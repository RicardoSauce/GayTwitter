This was the preliminary work from my summer research position with the McNair Scholars program. I hope to continue developing this ML project for the means of improving NLP models in place today.

Task | Work completed | Notes
------------------------------
Pull more tweets | Updated tweets/added more to corpus | Will want to add more, probably create a listener function to pull tweets.
Process and clean data | Done within twitter_senti.py | Will probably create bash script to clean up .csv files.
Implement Sentiment Analysis | Performs analysis on data set, accuracy may be off. | Most likely due to data processing as explained above.
Evaluation | Presents accuracy using Keras metrics | Add visualization for accuracy, validation, and error count
